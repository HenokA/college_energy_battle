We envision a website that can expose some of the problems that Yale is releasing 
publically but not actively endorsing. College Data on Waste Production, Energy Usage 
and Water Usage is the problem area tackeled by our operation through cross college 
comparisons and ranking systems.

Initially we will focus on the 12 residential colleges at Yale University:

1. Ezra Stiles College
2. Morse College
3. Branford College
4. Saybrook College
5. Silliman College
6. Trumbull College
7. Calhoun College
8. Timothy Dwight College
9. Berkeley College
10. Johnathan Edwards College
11. Davenport College
12. Pierson College

And we will focus on a few basic statistics including:

1. Cogen Electricity
2. Water
3. Solid Waste

Data visualizations through graphs and charts is our initial approach but we hope to
expand in the future to some of the following features:

1. Interactive data manipulation
2. Expanding to inter-college comparisons
3. Advanced D3 integration
