#Energize Yale

Phil Esterman and Henok Addis

Energize Yale is a energy conservation leaderboard for Yale's residential colleges. It visualizes data on how each college uses electricity & water and produces waste-- celebrating those who conserve and shaming those who don't. 

IM hoops rock, but we also want to compete to conserve. 


###Technical Guts: 

Energize Yale mines data from Yale Facilities' Energy Explorer. It then processes the data in Ruby and displays it using C3, a D3 wrapper.
